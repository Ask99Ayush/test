# 2. Key Features

## Overview

Carbon Offset Marketplace 2.0 provides a complete ecosystem for carbon credit management, trading, and verification. Here are all the key features explained in detail:

## 🪙 Tokenized Carbon Credits on Aptos

### What are Tokenized Carbon Credits?

Traditional carbon credits are certificates that exist in databases. Our tokenized credits are blockchain-based tokens that represent verified carbon reductions.

### How It Works

**Credit Creation Process**
1. Environmental project (solar farm, reforestation, etc.) applies for credits
2. AI calculates projected carbon reduction based on real data
3. IoT sensors verify actual environmental impact
4. Smart contract mints credits as tokens on Aptos blockchain
5. Each token represents exactly 1 ton of CO2 reduced

**Token Features**
- **Unique ID**: Every credit has blockchain-verified identity
- **Metadata**: Contains project details, creation date, verification data
- **Transferable**: Can be bought, sold, gifted, or transferred
- **Retirable**: One-way process that removes credits from circulation
- **Fractionable**: Credits can be split into smaller amounts (0.1 tons, etc.)

**Benefits Over Traditional Credits**
- Cannot be double-counted or counterfeited
- Complete transaction history visible on blockchain
- Instant global trading without intermediaries
- Programmable rules (auto-retirement, bulk transfers, etc.)
- Lower transaction costs and faster settlement
